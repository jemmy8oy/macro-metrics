# Backend Data Ingestion — Phase 5 Backlog

> **Status: Draft backlog — to be designed in GitHub Phase 5 (`[5a]`)**
> This is not an epic. It is a holding document for backend capability requirements captured during Phase 1 spec. The full design (service architecture, data models, API contract) will be produced in the `[5a]` backend design PR once the frontend skeleton is signed off.

---

## Capability summary

The backend must fetch time-series data from three external public APIs, normalise all series to a consistent format, and expose them to the frontend via a REST API. No database is required for MVP — the backend is a stateless proxy.

## Data sources

| Provider | Covers |
|---|---|
| **yfinance** | Gold, Oil, FTSE 100, S&P 500, Bitcoin |
| **FRED API** (free key) | US CPI, US Wages, US House Prices, CAPE, US 10yr Yield |
| **ONS API** (no key) | UK CPI, UK Wages, UK House Prices |
